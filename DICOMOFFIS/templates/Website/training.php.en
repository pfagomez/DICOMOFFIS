            <td>You will learn how typical problems in DICOM everyday life can be analyzed and mastered, and which open source tools can help you with this. You will also learn, with practical exercises, how to use some of these tools independently, i.e. to configure, execute and analyze the outputs on your own. A special focus of this course is the use of the tools of the DICOM open source toolkit DCMTK. Competent speakers who have been involved in DICOM programming and problem solving for many years will provide you with procedures and tools to successfully solve DICOM problems of the field.
