      <h2>DICOM and standardization efforts in medicine</h2>
      <p>In the last years, information and communication techonolgies have become more and more integrated into all areas of healthcare. Deploying such technologies crucially facilitates an organization's work flow in the administrative areas and also in the areas of patient treatment. In view of these facts it is evident that the significance of computer-based technologies in medicine will also in the future further increase.</p>
      <p>In health informatics, there are quite a number of standardization efforts to enable communication between medical devices from different manufacturers. In the area of digital imaging, the DICOM standard ("Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine"), which was first published in 1993, has become widely accepted.</p>
