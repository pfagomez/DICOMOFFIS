      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>DCMSTCOM implements a DICOM Storage Commitment SCU based on a C++ class library. The program STCOMSCU being part of this module accepts the
      corresponding response messages of a Storage Commitment SCP either on the same association that was used for the request or on a separate
      association. The DICOM datasets that were sent or received over the network as part of the messages can be stored as DICOM files for further
      analysis.
      </p>
      <h2 class="lowerh2">Features in detail</h2>
      <p>DCMSTCOM / STCOMSCU provides the following features: </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Support for Storage Commitment Push Model SOP Class as a Service Class User (SCU)</li>
        <li>Receipt of Storage Commitment response (N-EVENT-REPORT) on the same or a separate association</li>
        <li>Creation of the Storage Commitment request on the basis of given DICOM files</li>
        <li>Alternatively, direct definition of SOP Class UID and SOP Instance UID (class library only)</li>
        <li>Storage of DICOM request and response datasets as DICOM files (including status)</li>
        <li>If desired, detailed checking and report on each transaction in the form of a text file</li>
        <li>Options for tweaking DICOM network communication parameters</li>
      </ul>
      Further details can be found in the <a href="http://support.dcmtk.org/docs-products/stcomscu.html">documentation</a> of the program STCOMSCU.
      <p>DCMSTCOM is based on the OFFIS DICOM Toolkit <a class="textlink" href="dcmtk.php.en">DCMTK</a> and is available
         in different versions: There is a binary version as well as a source code variant. DCMSTCOM supports several Unix dialects (e. g. Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X) as well as Windows.
