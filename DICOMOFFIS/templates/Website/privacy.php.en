      <h3>Your Rights as a User</h3>
      <p>As a website user, the GDPR grants you certain rights when processing
      your personal data.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><i>Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR):</i> You have the right to obtain
        confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you is being
        processed, and, where that is the case access to the personal data and
        the information specified in Art. 15 GDPR.

        <li><i>Right to rectification and erasure (Art. 16 and 17 GDPR):</i> You have
        the right to obtain without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate
        personal data concerning you and, if necessary, the right to have
        incomplete personal data completed. You also have the right to obtain an
        erasure of the personal data concerning you without undue delay, if one
        of the reasons listed in Art. 17 GDPR applies, e.g. if the data is no
        longer necessary for the intended purpose.</li>

        <li><i>Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR):</i> If one of the
        conditions set forth in Art. 18 GDPR applies, you shall have the right
        to restrict the processing of your data to mere storage, e.g. if you
        revoke consent, to the processing, for the duration of a possible
        examination.</li>

        <li><i>Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR):</i> In certain situations,
        listed in Art. 20 GDPR, you have the right to receive the personal data
        concerning you in a structured, common and machine-readable format or
        demand a transmission of the data to another third party.</li>

        <li><i>Right to object (Art. 21 GDPR):</i> If the data is processed pursuant to
        Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (data processing for the purposes of the
        legitimate interests), you have the right to object to the processing at
        any time for reasons arising out of your particular situation. We will
        then no longer process personal data, unless there are demonstrably
        compelling legitimate grounds for processing, which override the
        interests, rights and freedoms of the person concerned, or the
        processing serves the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending
        legal claims.</li>

        <li><i>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority:</i> Pursuant to
        Art. 77 GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
        authority if you consider the processing of the data concerning you
        infringing data protection regulations. The right to lodge a complaint
        may be invoked in particular in the Member State of your habitual
        residence, place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.</li>
      </ol>
